## Dashlane-to-Bitwarden
# A simple script useful to switch from Dashlane to Bitwarden by converting the password file to the right format.
When I wanted to change my password manager, I noticed that each software had its own data format, so I wrote this little python script to convert Dashlane password files into Bitwarden format. 
> Usage : Python csvConvertor.py
